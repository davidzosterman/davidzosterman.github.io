Hello! I am a Physicist and data scientist seeking roles in machine learning and data science. I am open to in-person work (greater New York area) or remote work.

I completed my PhD in Physics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in February 2024 under Professor Scott Hertel. My dissertation is titled *Aluminum Quasiparticle Diffusion Measurements in Vacuum and Superfluid Helium 4*
